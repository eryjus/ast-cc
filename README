ast-cc is an Abstract Syntax Tree compiler.  It will translate specifications into C++ code that can be included in a larger translation project.  It is similar in nature to flex and bison and is intended to be part of the toolset for compiler creation.

Currently, ast-cc is in a simple form and does not have a mature command set.  ast-cc only supports C++.
